//So... What does GLTriangleBatch do?
//According to the description, it's basically a container form of the batch principle,
//based entirely on triangles.
//Adding a triangle, it checks to see if the vertices are 'close enough' to anything already in the vertex list.
//How? I mean, that sounds like it would be expensive.
//...and it is. I mean, damn. *Damn*! For each of the three vertices in the triangle, *for each of the vertices in the vertex list(!)*, it checks:
//each of the three elements of the vertex being tested against the vertex being tested against,
//each of the three elements of the normal,
//and both elements of the texture coordinate. That's eight tests,
//done three times per triangle
//done n times for each of those three times. To be sure, it's still O(n), which isn't *terrible*, but this is an insanely common task,
//done many times(once for each triangle added),
//and the number of vertices goes up by, presumably, at least one with every triangle! 
//This is going to take planning.
